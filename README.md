# Rop Emporium

Learn return-oriented programming through a series of challenges designed to teach ROP techniques in isolation, with minimal reverse-engineering and bug-hunting.

## Assignment 0: ret2win ([64 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/0.ret2win) and [32 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/0.ret2win32)) 

ret2win means 'return here to win' and it's recommended you start with this challenge. Visit the challenge page by clicking the link above to learn more.

## Assignment 1: split ([64 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/1.split) and [32 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/1.split32)) 

Combine elements from the ret2win challenge that have been split apart to beat this challenge. Learn how to use another tool whilst crafting a short ROP chain.

## Assignment 2: callme ([64 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/2.callme) and [32 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/2.callme32)) 

Chain calls to multiple imported methods with specific arguments and see how the differences between 64 & 64 bit calling conventions affect your ROP chain.

## Assignment 3: write4 ([64 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/3.write4) and [32 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/3.write432)) 

Find and manipulate gadgets to construct an arbitrary write primitive and use it to learn where and how to get your data into process memory.

## Assignment 4: badchars ([64 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/4.badchars) and [32 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/4.badchars32)) 

Learn to deal with badchars, characters that will not make it into process memory intact or cause other issues such as premature chain termination.

## Assignment 5: fluff ([64 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/5.fluff) and [32 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/5.fluff32)) 

Sort the useful gadgets from the fluff to construct another write primitive in this challenge. You'll have to get creative though, the gadgets aren't straight forward.

## Assignment 6: pivot ([64 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/6.pivot) and [32 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/6.pivot32)) 

Stack space is at a premium in this challenge and you'll have to pivot the stack onto a second ROP chain elsewhere in memory to ensure your success.

## Assignment 7: ret2csu ([32 bits](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/rop-emporium-exploits/tree/master/7.ret2csu)) 

Learn a ROP technique that lets you populate useful 64 bit calling convention registers like rdi, rsi and rdx even in an environment where gadgets are sparse.
